In this director, I try to implement a search functionality on the "Press Releases" sources
of the South Central Railway website.

Basic idea proposal:
- using the HTML of the "Press Releases" page, I will try to get the URL of each press release.
- for each URL, I will try to fetch the content.
- on the retrieved content, I will try to search for an input keyword.

Design thoughts:
- do I perform the URL fetch in parallel?
- do I store the content or just search on the fly?

Implementation thoughts:
- which language to use?
