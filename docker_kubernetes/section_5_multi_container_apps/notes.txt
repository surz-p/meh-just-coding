This chapter focuses more on a hands-on approach on the topics covered so far
We will look into "Building More Realistic Apps" (Multi-Container)

We will see
- Combining multiple services to one app
- Working with multiple containers

Demo in this chapter
- Contains 3 building blocks
- 1. Mongodb database
- 2. NodeJS REST API
- 3. React SPA Frontend

Some points to keep in mind before dockerizing these 3 units
- We need to have persistent data when dealing with Mongodb container
- We need to have restricted access to the database (user + pwd)
- We need to have persistent data for log data in NodeJS container
- We want live source code changes to reflect immediately in NodeJS box
- We want live source code changes to reflect immediately in React box

Notes
- Check README files in all three folders; database, backend and frontend
  for more detailed notes
- Note that it's just README, not README.md
